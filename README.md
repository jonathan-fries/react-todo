# react-todo
The React-based to-do list.

This is a react-based to do list that covers the following things:

1. React basics - JSX, Webpack, components
2. SPA using BrowserRouter
3. One way binding with props.
4. Manipulation of state and view update across nested components.


The file called 'the-basics-setup.txt' covers how to construct a similar project in a series of a few steps.  Documentation and explanation web links that I used to develop this included and end of file.
